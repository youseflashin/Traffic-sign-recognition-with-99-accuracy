# Traffic-sign-recognition-with-99-accuracy
Using the GTSRB dataset, I resized images for uniformity, applied data augmentation for better model generalization, and visualized data. I trained a CNN, achieving 99% accuracy, and evaluated it using metrics like precision and recall. Finally, I deployed the model with Flask for real-time predictions.
